# Substitutes Project (Still looking for a name üòê)

This is a school project (not homework!) to help school manage teacher substitutions,
A teacher (super teacher) enters all classes, and when teachers report Absences classes are marked that they need a Substitution,The super teacher then can mark who Substitutes that class.

This project is done for now, but will likely have more development in the future

After Running the containers, this command should be run to create a super user:
``` shell
~$ docker exec -it Substitutes_backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```
docker-compose.yaml:
